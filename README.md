## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Djangonian-Grapes

**Description:** 
In modern web development, the demand for dynamic and customizable content is ever-growing. However, traditional CMS packages like Django CMS and Wagtail CMS can feel too limited, while other feature-rich tools like Wordpress or Builder.io will often tie you to paid features or traffic. Here enters GrapesJS, a powerful open-source web builder framework that allows developers and non-technical users to create and manage rich web content through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. When integrated with Django, this combination becomes a formidable tool for building scalable, feature-rich web applications with seamless content management capabilities.
